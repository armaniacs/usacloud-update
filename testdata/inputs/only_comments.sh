# This file contains only comments - no actual commands

# This is a comprehensive comment-only test file
# Used to test edge case handling when no transformations are needed

# Example of what commands might look like:
# usacloud server list --output-type csv
# usacloud disk list --output-type tsv

# But none of these are actual commands, just comments

# Multi-line comment block:
# usacloud iso-image list
# usacloud startup-script create
# usacloud product-server list

# Even more comments with potential transformations:
# usacloud database list --zone = all
# usacloud server list --selector "Name=test"

# Final comment
# End of comment-only file
